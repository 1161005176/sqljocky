{"name":"SQLJocky","body":"SQLJocky\r\n========\r\n\r\nThis is a MySQL connector for the Dart programming language. It is in early stages of development,\r\nso please report issues, contribute code and suggest how I could make this better. (I won't \r\nguarantee I'll agree with you). Please expect this code to change, possibly massively, in the near future.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSqlJocky uses an asynchronous model to access the database, due to Dart's (probably sensible) lack \r\nof blocking reads on sockets. The API for the library can be found in lib/interfaces.dart. Examples\r\nand suchlike may come in the future.\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIt is released under the GPL, because it uses a modified part of mysql's include/mysql_com.h in constants.dart, \r\nwhich is licensed under the GPL. I would prefer to release it under the BSD Licence, but there you go.\r\n\r\nIncludes some hashing code from the closure library, which contains its own copyright notice.\r\n\r\nThe Name\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIt is named after [Jocky Wilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocky_Wilson), the late, great \r\ndarts player. (Hence the lack of an 'e' in Jocky.)","tagline":"MySQL Connector for Dart","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
