        <h1>SQLJocky</h1>

<p>This is a MySQL connector for the Dart programming language. It is in early stages of development,
so please report issues, contribute code and suggest how I could make this better. (I won't 
guarantee I'll agree with you). Please expect this code to change, possibly massively, in the near future.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>SqlJocky uses an asynchronous model to access the database, due to Dart's (probably sensible) lack 
of blocking reads on sockets. The API for the library can be found in lib/interfaces.dart. Examples
and suchlike may come in the future.</p>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>It is released under the GPL, because it uses a modified part of mysql's include/mysql_com.h in constants.dart, 
which is licensed under the GPL. I would prefer to release it under the BSD Licence, but there you go.</p>

<p>Includes some hashing code from the closure library, which contains its own copyright notice.</p>

<h2>The Name</h2>

<p>It is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocky_Wilson">Jocky Wilson</a>, the late, great 
darts player. (Hence the lack of an 'e' in Jocky.)</p>
